# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `library/kit/` is the published UI kit package (`@sellgar/kit`). Source lives in `library/kit/src/` with `components/`, `subcomponents/`, `theme/`, and `utils/`, and entry at `library/kit/src/index.ts`.
- Build outputs are emitted to `library/kit/dist/` and type declarations to `library/kit/types/` (generated by the build).
- `clients/storybook/` is the local playground/docs app. Stories and helpers live under `clients/storybook/src/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run these from the repo root (Yarn v4 workspaces):
- `yarn kit:build` — build the library package via Vite.
- `yarn storybook:start` — start Storybook at port 3010.
- `yarn storybook:build` — build the library and then build Storybook into `clients/storybook/build/`.
- `yarn kit:publish` — publish `@sellgar/kit` to npm (requires login).
- `yarn workspace @library/kit dev` — watch build the library package for local development.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript + React (ESM). Keep source in `library/kit/src/` and update exports in `library/kit/src/index.ts`.
- Formatting: Prettier is configured (`.prettierrc`); follow its defaults (notably 160 print width and single quotes).
- Linting: ESLint is configured for TypeScript; Stylelint is configured for SCSS (`.stylelintrc.js`). Run linters via your editor or add a script if needed.
- SCSS variables follow `kebab-case` per the stylelint rule (`^[a-z]+([a-z0-9-]+[a-z0-9]+)?$`).

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test runner or test scripts are configured in this repo. If you add tests, prefer colocating them near the components (e.g., `Button.test.tsx`) and add a root-level script to run them.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages are short, imperative, and lowercase (e.g., `storybook v10`, `new table`). Keep them brief and topic-focused.
- PRs should include: a short description, linked issue (if any), and screenshots or a Storybook link for UI changes.

## Tooling & Environment Notes
- Required runtime: Node `>=22` and Yarn `4.10.3` (see `package.json`).
- This is a Yarn workspace repo; use `yarn workspace <pkg> <command>` for package-specific commands.
